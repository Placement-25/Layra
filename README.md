## **üîç What is LYRA?**

LYRA stands for:

* **L ‚Äì Logical:** Focused on structured reasoning and decision-making.
* **A ‚Äì Augmented :** 
* **Y ‚Äì Yielding:** Provides actionable results, insights, and predictions.
* **R ‚Äì Retrieval:** Core RAG-powered intelligent information fetching.
* **A ‚Äì Agent:** Functions as a multi-agent AI system that collaborates across domains.

Unlike traditional RAG systems that only retrieve data and answer queries, LYRA is **multi-domain, multi-modal, and predictive**, capable of handling:

* **Text, images, and tabular data.**
* **Trend analysis, forecasting, and reasoning.**
* **Explainable AI (with sources, confidence scores, and knowledge graphs).**

## **üöÄ Key Features**

* **Hybrid Retrieval + Reasoning:**
  Combines vector databases, knowledge graphs, and LLMs for deeper insights.
* **Multi-Agent Architecture:**
  Different expert agents (finance, legal, medical, etc.) collaborate to give contextual answers.
* **Predictive Analysis:**
  Uses AutoML for forecasting trends (e.g., stock predictions, growth patterns).
* **Explainability:**
  Every answer includes citations, confidence scores, and visual knowledge maps.
* **Multi-Modal Input:**
  Works with text, images, audio transcripts, and structured datasets.
* **Self-Updating Knowledge:**
  Automatic ingestion of new data (APIs, web sources, RSS feeds).
* **Visualization Output:**
  Generates charts, reports, and summaries for structured data.

## **üß† How LAYRA Works (Architecture)**

1. **Knowledge Ingestion:** Data from multiple domains is converted into embeddings and stored in a **Vector DB** (like Pinecone/FAISS).
2. **Hybrid Retrieval:** Combines **vector search + graph queries** to fetch contextually rich information.
3. **Reasoning Layer:** LLMs + AutoML models analyze, predict, and synthesize insights.
4. **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Specialized AI agents (domain-specific) collaborate on queries.
5. **Explainability & Visualization:** Outputs include **citations, graphs, and interactive reports**.

## **üí° Real-Life Use Cases**

* **Business Intelligence:** Predict market trends using mixed datasets (CSV + reports).
* **Healthcare:** Analyze medical images + documents to suggest diagnosis trends.
* **Legal AI:** Cross-reference laws, case studies, and business impact.
* **Education:** Acts as a universal knowledge tutor across multiple fields.
* **Research:** Summarizes large PDFs, connects research papers, and generates hypotheses.
